SDLOpenGL is a mini-graphic engine developed for the Computer Graphics course in Computer Engineering - Unige.
It's written in C++ and uses OpenGL and SDL2 for cross-platform compatibility.
Developed in collaboration with Edoardo Ferrante and Enrico Ferro.

There's included the game, as the actual subject of the Computer Graphics assignment, "Morte's Quest or How I Became to Love Being a Skull". There's no really a story, it's just an implementation of the engine.

# TODOs and Refactors

 - Refactor the Core class in order to totally separate the GameClass from it
 - A series of refactors concerning the FontManager and its API, the shader subsystem which is to be improved by providing a uniform pipeline for every shader
 - You can find [TODO] and [REFACTOR] tags inside the code for further information
